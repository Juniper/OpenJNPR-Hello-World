print("Hello World")

When we [start at the very beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEodUg43Zpo), we start with the Hello World Program. This repository contains the Junos OS version of that with a simple example pulling either get facts via an EZ library or the CLI command "show system information".

These are the languages or tools which can currently be found in this repository:
- [Ansible](https://github.com/Juniper/ansible-junos-stdlib)
- [Perl](https://github.com/Juniper/netconf-perl)
- [PyEZ](https://github.com/Juniper/py-junos-eznc)
- [Python](https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient)
- [SLAX](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/automation-scripting/topics/concept/junos-script-automation-slax-overview.html)
  
These are additional examples which should be added:
- [PHP](https://github.com/Juniper/netconf-php)
- [Java](https://github.com/Juniper/netconf-java)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/Juniper/net-netconf)
- [Go](https://github.com/Juniper/go-netconf)
- [Saltstack](https://github.com/Juniper/docker-saltstack-junos#getting-started--hello-world-with-engine)
- [RubyEZ](https://github.com/Juniper/ruby-junos-ez-stdlib)

Hopefully, people see that one can use whichever tool one wants to get the same/similar infomation.  Also, looking at the different syntax of each language is interesting.
